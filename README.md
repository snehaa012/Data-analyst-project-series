The Iris dataset analysis project involves exploring and visualizing the famous Iris flower dataset, which contains samples of iris flowers with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, across three species (setosa, versicolor, virginica). Using Power BI, you can create an interactive dashboard showcasing various visualizations like scatter plots, histograms, and box plots to analyze relationships between features and species. Key insights include species classification, feature distributions, and correlations. This project enhances data visualization skills, enabling users to present data insights effectively and make data-driven decisions.
